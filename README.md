## ⚡ Key Features

- ✅ **High Performance**: Built from the ground up with speed in mind. Pure byte-level operations, zero-reflection runtime mode.
- 🧩 **Fully Compliant**: Conforms to the BSON specification v1.1.
- 🔧 **Custom POJO Binding**: Annotation-based field mapping for flexible document-object translation.
- 📦 **No Dependencies**: Self-contained. No `bson`, `jackson`, or `gson` dependencies.
- 🔍 **Tiny Footprint**: Extremely lightweight—ideal for microservices, mobile, and embedded systems.
- 📡 **NIO-Friendly**: Supports reading/writing BSON from `ByteBuffer`, `InputStream`, `OutputStream`, or memory-mapped files for async/event-driven systems.
